detailed_ingredients:
  - '1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast or thigh, cut into thin strips'
  - '1/4 cup soy sauce'
  - '2 tablespoons brown sugar'
  - '2 tablespoons vegetable oil'
  - '1 teaspoon ground cumin'
  - '1 teaspoon ground coriander'
  - '1 teaspoon turmeric'
  - '1/2 teaspoon garlic powder'
  - '1/2 teaspoon onion powder'
  - '1/2 teaspoon ground ginger'
  - '1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper'
  - '1/2 cup peanut butter'
  - '1/4 cup sweet soy sauce'
  - '1/4 cup water'
  - 'Juice of 1 lime'
  - 'Wooden skewers'
instructions:
  - 'In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, brown sugar, vegetable oil, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garlic powder, onion powder, ginger, and cayenne pepper.'
  - 'Add the chicken strips to the bowl and stir to coat them evenly with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to 8 hours.'
  - 'Soak the wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning on the grill.'
  - 'Preheat the grill to medium-high heat.'
  - 'Thread the chicken strips onto the skewers, making sure they are evenly spaced.'
  - 'Place the skewers on the grill and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through and has grill marks.'
  - 'In a small bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, sweet soy sauce, water, and lime juice until smooth.'
  - 'Serve the chicken skewers hot with the peanut dipping sauce on the side.'
tips:
  - 'You can also cook the chicken skewers in the oven by placing them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and baking at 400Â°F for 12-15 minutes, flipping halfway through.'
  - 'If you don''t have sweet soy sauce, you can substitute regular soy sauce and add a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar to the peanut dipping sauce.'
  - 'Sate Ayam can be served as a main dish with rice or noodles, or as an appetizer with a side of cucumber and onion slices.'
