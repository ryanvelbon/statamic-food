instructions:
  - 'In a bowl, mix together the cubed tofu, beaten eggs, minced garlic, chopped shallot, salt, sugar, chicken bouillon powder, and ground pepper.'
  - 'Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Scoop 1/4 cup of the tofu mixture and carefully drop it into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes on each side. Repeat until all the mixture is used up.'
  - 'In a small saucepan, mix together the peanut butter, sweet soy sauce, kecap manis, lime juice, water, and chili flakes (if using). Cook over low heat until the sauce is smooth and heated through.'
  - 'To serve, place the fried tofu on a plate and pour the peanut sauce over it. Garnish with chopped scallions or fried shallots if desired.'
tips:
  - 'Drain the tofu well before using to prevent excess moisture from making the mixture too wet.'
  - 'Use a non-stick pan or a well-seasoned cast iron pan for best results.'
  - 'Adjust the spiciness of the sauce to your liking by adding more or less chili flakes.'
