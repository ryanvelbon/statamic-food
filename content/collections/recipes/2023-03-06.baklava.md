detailed_ingredients:
  - '1 lb phyllo dough'
  - '1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts or pistachios'
  - '1 cup unsalted butter, melted'
  - '1/2 cup sugar'
  - '1/2 cup honey'
  - '1/2 cup water'
  - '1 tsp vanilla extract'
  - '1 cinnamon stick'
instructions:
  - 'Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).'
  - 'In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped nuts and sugar. Mix well and set aside.'
  - 'Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter.'
  - 'Take a sheet of phyllo dough and place it in the baking dish. Brush the phyllo dough with melted butter.'
  - 'Repeat this process with 5-6 more sheets of phyllo dough, making sure to brush each layer with melted butter.'
  - 'Sprinkle a layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo dough.'
  - 'Repeat the layering process with the phyllo dough and melted butter, followed by another layer of nuts. Continue layering until you have used all of the nut mixture.'
  - 'Top the final layer of nuts with 5-6 more sheets of phyllo dough, making sure to brush each layer with melted butter.'
  - 'Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into diamond-shaped pieces.'
  - 'Bake the baklava in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until it is golden brown and crispy.'
  - 'While the baklava is baking, make the syrup. In a small saucepan, combine the honey, water, vanilla extract, and cinnamon stick. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.'
  - 'Once the baklava is cooked, remove it from the oven and pour the syrup over the top of the pastry.'
  - 'Let the baklava cool completely before serving.'
tips:
  - 'Make sure to keep the phyllo dough covered with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out while you are working with it.'
  - 'You can use any type of nut for the filling, but walnuts and pistachios are the most common.'
  - 'The syrup should be poured over the baklava while it is still hot, but not boiling, to allow it to absorb the liquid.'
