instructions:
  - 'Begin by making the meatballs. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, egg, minced garlic, soy sauce, cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Mix well and form into small meatballs.'
  - 'In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the crushed garlic, sliced ginger, bruised lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, salt, and white pepper to the pot.'
  - 'Once the broth is boiling, add the meatballs to the pot and let them simmer for about 15 minutes, or until they are cooked through.'
  - 'While the meatballs are cooking, prepare the garnish by cooking the noodles and slicing the scallions.'
  - 'Once the meatballs are cooked, remove them from the broth and set them aside.'
  - 'Strain the broth through a fine mesh sieve to remove any solids.'
  - 'To serve, place the cooked noodles in a bowl and add the meatballs on top. Ladle the hot broth over the meatballs and noodles.'
  - 'Garnish with bean sprouts, sliced scallions, fried onions, and chili sauce.'
tips:
  - 'You can add other ingredients to the broth, such as carrots or mushrooms, for added flavor and nutrition.'
  - 'For a spicier broth, add more white pepper or chili sauce.'
  - 'Bakso is typically served with a side of chili sauce for added heat.'
