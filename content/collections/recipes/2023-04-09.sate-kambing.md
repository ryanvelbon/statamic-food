instructions:
  - 'In a large bowl, combine the vegetable oil, sweet soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Mix well until it forms a smooth marinade.'
  - 'Add the goat meat cubes to the bowl and toss until the meat is fully coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors penetrate the meat.'
  - 'Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated meat onto the bamboo skewers, about 4-5 pieces per skewer.'
  - 'Grill the skewers for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the meat is fully cooked and slightly charred. Be careful not to overcook the meat, or it will become tough and chewy.'
  - 'To make the peanut sauce, heat the vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and chilies, and cook for about a minute until fragrant.'
  - 'Add the ground peanuts, sweet soy sauce, tamarind paste, palm sugar, and water to the saucepan. Stir well and bring to a simmer.'
  - 'Let the sauce simmer for about 5-7 minutes until it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool.'
  - 'Serve the grilled sate kambing with the peanut sauce on the side, along with steamed rice and sliced cucumber and tomato.'
tips:
  - 'If you can''t find goat meat, you can substitute it with lamb or beef.'
  - 'Soak the bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before use to prevent them from burning on the grill.'
  - 'To make the meat more tender, you can add a tablespoon of kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) and a tablespoon of vegetable oil to the marinade.'
