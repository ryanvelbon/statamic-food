  - 'Sambal, for serving'
instructions:
  - 'In a large pot, add the beef tongue, tripe, and brisket. Add enough water to cover the meat and bring it to a boil over high heat. Lower the heat to medium-low and let it simmer for about 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Skim off any impurities that rise to the surface.'
  - 'In a blender, blend the lemongrass, turmeric leaves, bay leaves, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, garlic, shallots, and roasted candlenuts with a little water until it forms a smooth paste.'
  - 'Heat the cooking oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat.'
  - 'Add the spice paste to the pan and sauté it for about 2-3 minutes or until fragrant.'
  - 'Add the sautéed spice paste to the pot of cooked meat and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.'
  - 'In a separate pot, cook the glutinous rice with enough water until it becomes soft and sticky. Serve the rice in individual bowls.'
  - 'Ladle the Coto Makassar over the rice in each bowl. Garnish with toasted coconut and crispy fried onion. Serve with lime wedges and sambal on the side.'
tips:
  - 'For a spicier soup, add more sambal or chili flakes.'
  - 'Make sure to remove any impurities that rise to the surface while boiling the meat to ensure a clear soup.'
  - 'Make sure to boil the beef bones and meat for a long time until they are very tender, as this will give the soup a rich and flavorful taste.'
  - 'You can use different types of meat such as beef tripe or offal to give the soup a more unique taste and texture.'
  - 'Don''t forget to add the toasted rice and peanuts to the spice mixture, as this will help thicken the soup and add a nice nutty flavor.'
  - 'The soup can be quite spicy due to the use of chili flakes and pepper, so adjust the spice level to your preference.'
  - 'Coto Makassar is traditionally served with a side of steamed rice cakes called ketupat, but you can also serve it with regular steamed rice or bread.'
  - 'Garnish the soup with fresh cilantro, fried shallots, and a squeeze of lime juice to enhance the flavors and add freshness.'
