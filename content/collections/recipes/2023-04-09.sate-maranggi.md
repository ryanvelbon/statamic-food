instructions:
  - 'In a large bowl, combine the vegetable oil, sweet soy sauce, lime juice, garlic, coriander, cumin, turmeric, salt, and pepper. Mix well until it forms a smooth marinade.'
  - 'Add the beef cubes to the bowl and toss until the meat is fully coated with the marinade. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors penetrate the meat.'
  - 'Preheat a grill to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated beef onto the bamboo skewers, about 4-5 pieces per skewer.'
  - 'Grill the skewers for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the meat is fully cooked and slightly charred. Be careful not to overcook the meat, or it will become tough and chewy.'
  - 'To make the chili sauce, combine the chopped chilies, garlic, lime juice, salt, sugar, and shrimp paste in a small bowl. Add the boiling water and mix well until everything is fully combined.'
  - 'Serve the grilled sate maranggi with the chili sauce on the side, along with steamed rice and sliced cucumber and tomato.'
tips:
  - 'For a more tender meat, you can marinate it for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.'
  - 'If you don''t have sweet soy sauce, you can substitute it with regular soy sauce and add a tablespoon of honey or brown sugar to the marinade.'
  - 'If you like your chili sauce spicier, you can add more chilies to the recipe.'
