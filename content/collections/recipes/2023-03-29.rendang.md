detailed_ingredients:
  - '2 lbs. beef chuck, cut into bite-sized pieces'
  - '3 cups of coconut milk'
  - '2 stalks of lemongrass, bruised'
  - '6 kaffir lime leaves'
  - '1 turmeric leaf (optional)'
  - '4 red chilies, seeded and chopped'
  - '4 cloves of garlic, minced'
  - '1 inch of fresh ginger, peeled and minced'
  - '1 teaspoon of salt'
  - '1 teaspoon of tamarind paste'
  - '2 tablespoons of brown sugar'
  - '1 tablespoon of vegetable oil'
instructions:
  - 'Begin by heating up the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic, chopped chilies, and minced ginger, and stir for a few minutes until fragrant.'
  - 'Add the beef to the pot and cook until it is browned on all sides.'
  - 'Add the coconut milk, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and turmeric leaf to the pot. Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a boil.'
  - 'Reduce the heat to low and simmer the mixture for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. The liquid should reduce and the beef should be tender and fall apart easily.'

  - 'Continue to simmer the mixture for another 30-60 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the beef is coated with a rich and flavorful sauce.'

tips:
  - 'Rendang is traditionally served with steamed rice and a side of vegetables, such as green beans or broccoli.'
  - 'You can use any type of beef for this dish, but beef chuck is preferred as it has a good amount of fat and collagen that will break down during the long cooking process.'
  - 'Use fresh ingredients, such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, and turmeric leaf, for the best flavor.'
