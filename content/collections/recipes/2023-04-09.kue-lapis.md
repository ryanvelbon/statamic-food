  - sugar
  - eggs
  - flour
  - vanilla-extract
  - cinnamon

detailed_ingredients:
  - '500 grams of unsalted butter, softened'
  - '250 grams of sugar'
  - '10 eggs, separated'
  - '150 grams of all-purpose flour'
  - '2 teaspoons of vanilla extract'
  - '1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon'
  - '1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg'
  - '1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves'
  - '1/4 teaspoon of salt'
  - 'Food coloring (optional)'
instructions:
  - 'Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease a 9-inch (23 cm) cake pan and line it with parchment paper.'
  - 'In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy.'
  - 'Add the egg yolks to the bowl, one at a time, and beat until fully incorporated.'
  - 'Sift the flour into the bowl and mix until fully combined.'
  - 'In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks.'
  - 'Gently fold the egg whites into the cake batter, one-third at a time, until fully incorporated.'
  - 'Divide the cake batter into two equal portions. Add the vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to one portion and mix well. If using food coloring, add a few drops to this portion as well.'
  - 'Pour a thin layer of the spiced batter into the prepared cake pan and bake for about 10 minutes or until it is fully set.'
  - 'Repeat this process, alternating between the spiced batter and the plain batter, until all the batter has been used. Each layer should be about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick.'
  - 'Let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.'
  - 'Once the cake has cooled, slice it into thin pieces and serve.'
tips:
  - 'This recipe may take some time and patience, but the end result is worth it.'
  - 'If you prefer a more colorful cake, you can use food coloring to create different layers.'
  - 'You can also add other spices or flavorings to the batter, such as cardamom or orange zest.'
