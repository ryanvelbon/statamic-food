instructions:
  - 'Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the oxtail pieces and brown them on all sides for about 5-7 minutes. Remove the oxtail from the pot and set it aside.'
  - 'In the same pot, add the onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Cook until the onions are translucent and the tomatoes are softened, for about 3-5 minutes.'
  - 'Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, bay leaves, salt, and ground pepper to the pot. Stir well.'
  - 'Add the water to the pot and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 2-2.5 hours or until the oxtail is tender.'
  - 'Remove the oxtail from the pot and set it aside. Add the carrots and potatoes to the pot and let them cook for about 10-15 minutes or until they are tender.'
  - 'Add the oxtail and chopped celery to the pot and let them cook for an additional 5-10 minutes until everything is heated through.'
  - 'Serve the soup hot, garnished with fried shallots and sambal on the side.'
tips:
  - 'For a more flavorful broth, you can add a beef bone or beef shank to the pot before adding the oxtail.'
  - 'If you''re short on time, you can use a pressure cooker to cook the oxtail in about 45 minutes instead of simmering it on the stove.'
  - 'You can also add other vegetables to the soup, such as bok choy or corn.'
