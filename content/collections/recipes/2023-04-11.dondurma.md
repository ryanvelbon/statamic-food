description: 'Dondurma is a traditional Turkish ice cream that has a unique, stretchy texture and is typically flavored with mastic gum. It is made using a combination of milk, sugar, and salep, a starchy powder made from the root of the orchid plant. Dondurma is traditionally served by street vendors who perform playful tricks with the ice cream, such as teasing customers by pulling the ice cream cone away before letting them take a bite. This recipe makes four servings and takes approximately 40 minutes to prepare and cook.'
