detailed_ingredients:
  - '4 boneless chicken breasts'
  - '1 cup of all-purpose flour'
  - '1/2 cup of cornstarch'
  - '1 tablespoon of garlic powder'
  - '1 tablespoon of onion powder'
  - '1 tablespoon of salt'
  - '1 tablespoon of paprika'
  - '1 teaspoon of ground coriander'
  - '1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin'
  - '2 cups of vegetable oil, for frying'

  - '1/2 teaspoon of tamarind paste'
  - '1 tablespoon of sugar'
  - '2 cups of chopped cabbage'
  - '1/2 cup of sliced cucumber'
  - '1/2 cup of sliced tomatoes'
instructions:
  - 'Begin by pounding the chicken breasts until they are evenly thin. You can use a meat mallet or a rolling pin for this.'
  - 'In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, paprika, coriander, and cumin. Mix everything together until well combined.'
  - 'Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture, making sure it is coated on all sides.'
  - 'Heat up the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the pan and fry until it is golden brown and crispy on both sides. This should take about 10-12 minutes.'
  - 'In a separate mixing bowl, combine the water, salt, tamarind paste, and sugar. Mix everything together until the sugar and salt have dissolved.'
  - 'Arrange the chopped cabbage, sliced cucumber, and sliced tomatoes on a plate.'
  - 'Once the chicken is done, remove it from the pan and place it on a paper towel to drain any excess oil.'
  - 'Place the chicken on top of the vegetables on the plate and serve with the spicy sambal sauce.'
tips:
  - 'You can adjust the level of spiciness of the sambal sauce by adding more or less chilies.'
  - 'If you want a crispier chicken, you can double-coat it by dipping it in egg wash and then in the flour mixture again before frying.'
  - 'Serve the Ayam Penyet with steamed rice for a complete meal.'
